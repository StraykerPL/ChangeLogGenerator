# ChangeLog Generator
Simple C# app to create changelog files dynamically. To create file, user have to fill in appropriate text boxes and choose directory to save file.
# Building
To build app, you have to compile it with Visual C# .NET compiler form MS Visual Studio. Project was written on .NET Framework v4.6.1, so you will need it to build app properly. You can use MonoDevelop or something similar to build app, but I didn't test it. Feel free to make research!
